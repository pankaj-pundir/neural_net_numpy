# neural_net_numpy
A basic **Doubled Layer** neural net coded from scratch in Numpy.

This Repository deals with the basic concepts of 

* [Deep learning](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj7u5mIsIzgAhXIbisKHadPChYQFjAAegQIBxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fintro-to-artificial-intelligence%2Fdeep-learning-series-1-intro-to-deep-learning-abb1780ee20&usg=AOvVaw3Q8OO_w48MW85CmlM7W46_).
* [Back Propagation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q555kfIFUCM) 
* [Activation Functions](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/10/fundamentals-deep-learning-activation-functions-when-to-use-them/)
* Saving model and loading with [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)

## Prerequisite
Basic modules that are required are listed below 
```python
 sudo pip install sklearn numpy pickle-mixin 
 ```
 
 ## Description
 * Weights are initialised Randomly including Bias.
 * **genANDData()** function to generate random data for training network for *And* Gate.
 * Saving and loading weights are available within the **AlvinNet** class.
 
> Hope, This repo will clear many concepts
> Spread knowledge
